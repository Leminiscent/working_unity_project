## About the Project

This project is a 2D monster-taming, turn-based RPG built in Unity. You control a party of battlers led by a "Commander," a unique battler who inspires and leads others into battle. Rival Commanders and other NPCs that populate the world can be engaged with in battle, traded with, and more. The battle system includes multiple actions such as attacking, guarding, talking to recruit other battlers, using items, and more. The focus of this prototype is on developing and refining the core gameplay mechanics to achieve engaging and intuitive interactions. After these foundational systems are fully implemented and refined, future iterations will concentrate on world-building, narrative development, and visual design.

## Features

- **Main Menu**  
  Provides options to continue from your last save, begin a new game, or quit.

  ![Main Menu](Media/Images/main_menu.png)

- **Character Selection**  
  Lets you pick a Commander from a set of predefined characters, each with assigned types and stats. This chosen character remains central to your party throughout the game.

- **World Exploration and Interaction**  
  Gives you the ability to move freely in a 2D environment and interact with NPCs, merchants, innkeepers, quest givers, and more. You can open the in-game menu to view your party, inventory, and barracks, or to save/load the game.

- **Party Management**  
  Supports a maximum of six battlers (one Commander and up to five others). You can reorder the party and view detailed summaries of each member.

- **Deputy Mechanic**  
  Designates the second battler (or the first if the Commander has been moved from the first slot) as the deputy who follows the Commander around. Future plans include giving the deputy unique abilities to influence exploration and battles.

- **Inventory System**  
  Organizes items by category and shows your GP (in-game currency). You can use specific items from this screen.

- **Barracks Organization**  
  Provides a storage area for extra battlers, split into depots for organizational purposes. You can move battlers between your party and these depots, but the Commander must remain in the party.

- **Battle System**  
  Utilizes a turn-based combat flow with six actions:
  - **Fight:** Choose a move at the cost of SP. If SP of all moves is depleted, a weaker fallback move is used.
  - **Talk:** Available only to the Commander in rogue battles to attempt recruiting an opposing battler.
  - **Item:** Opens the inventory to use recovery items.
  - **Guard:** Temporarily reduces damage taken during the round.
  - **Switch:** Reorders party members during combat.
  - **Run:** Attempts to flee the encounter.

- **Battle Variants**  
  Commander Battles and Rogue Battles differ in recruitment rules and escape restrictions. In Commander Battles, you cannot recruit opposing battlers and cannot flee.

- **Experience and Leveling**  
  XP is awarded for defeating enemies. Battlers can level up, learn new moves, and transform into stronger forms.
