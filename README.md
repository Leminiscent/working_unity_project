## About The Project

This project is a demonstration of a 2D monster-taming role-playing game developed in Unity. The game assigns the role of Commander to the player to control a group of battlers. Gameplay includes world exploration, combat, and party management. The game world contains rival Commanders and non-player characters. The battle system supports multiple actions and includes a process to recruit opposing battlers under specified conditions.

- **Deputy Mechanics:**

- **Battle System:**  

  Implements a turn-based combat system with six actions:

  - **Fight:** Select moves that consume SP; if SP is insufficient, a fallback move is executed.
  - **Talk:** Initiates a recruitment process in which the target battler questions the player.
  - **Item:** Opens the inventory for item usage.
  - **Guard:** Lowers damage received during the round.
  - **Switch:** Permits switching battlers during combat.
  - **Run:** Attempts to exit the battle.

2. **Character Selection:**  
   - Select a Commander from the list of characters with assigned types and statistics.

3. **Exploration:**  
   - Navigate the game world and interact with non-player characters for services, quests, and information.

4. **Party and Inventory Management:**  
   - Use the party screen to view battler details and reorder the lineup.
   - Access the inventory to view items by category and the current GP balance.
   - Use the barracks screen to manage additional battlers; navigate among depots and slots using keyboard inputs.

5. **Battle Operations:**  
   - Initiate battles by encountering enemy Commanders or rogue battlers.
   - Select battle actions from the following options: Fight, Talk, Item, Guard, Switch, and Run.
